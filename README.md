####### In the name of ALLAH #######

When you check the repository, you may not see some files. So, my suggestion is to download the repository to avoid the problem.

First if you are completely beginner in programming, check the "Beginner Level 01.txt" file.
After that, check the "Beginner Level 02.txt" file. Then, "Beginner Level 03.txt". After completing the 3 steps read and follow the instructions of "Competitive_Programming_Guide.pdf".

Some Good Online Judges to Practice and Compete for all:

Note: If you are unable to code at the beginning level of a problem, see others' code. So, google it. But first try your best.
