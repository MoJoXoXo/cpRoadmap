####### In the name of ALLAH #######

When you check the repository, you may not see some files. So, my suggestion is to download the repository to avoid the problem.

First if you are completely beginner in programming, check the "Beginner Level 01.txt" file.
After that, check the "Beginner Level 02.txt" file. Then, "Beginner Level 03.txt". After completing the 3 steps, read and follow the instructions of "Competitive_Programming_Guide.pdf".

Some Good Online Judges to Practice and Compete for all:

 1. https://www.codeforces.com
 2. https://www.codechef.com
 3. https://www.atcoder.jp
 4. https://www.leetcode.com
 5. https://www.lightoj.com
 6. https://www.spoj.com
 7. https://www.hackerearth.com

Note: If you are unable to code at the beginning level of a problem, see others' code. So, google it. But first try your best.

Now most important thing is "Time Complexity":
If you know how to code, then you must know how to calculate the time complexity of a code. So, check the "Big O Notation.txt" file. Whenever you code for a problem, you have to calculate the time complexity. It is one of the best ways to practice it.

Next one thing is "Space Complexity".
